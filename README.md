Project Timed Typing Test App 
 
 
Purpose:  
In this project you are going to create the functionality for a timed typing test app.  

Requirements: 
To complete this project you will add to the starter code provided. 
You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. 
For this project you will not need the JQuery library. 
If you feel the need to use it we can discuss in class. 
You may edit the structure of the provided HTML and CSS to better fit your preferred style. 
You may use lecture slides and the past hw’s for sample code but make sure to make it your own.  
 
The purpose of this project is to make sure you have an understanding of JavaScript objects, functions, click events, event listeners, and changing DOM elements.  
 
Functionality: 
 
● Run a standard minute/second/hundredths timer 

● Match the text entered with the provided text on the page. Notify user of progress 

● Proper Event listeners for keyboard and button input 

● Start Over button clears input text, changes default notification,  and sets clock to zero. 
 
 
What I will be grading on: 
 
Implementation of all the functionality. 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS has proper formatting and comments where appropriate. 
Web page renders properly in Chrome. 
Any assets are included in submission.  
 
Extra Credit Options: 
● Display a words per minute count.  

● Display the number of errors the person does per test.  

● Add an array of different texts so the tester can switch between different texts to test.  
 
Cheating: 
This project will be an individual project. 
You can discuss this project with other students. 
You can explain what needs to be done and give suggestions on how to do it. 
You cannot share source code. 
If two projects are submitted which show significant similarity in source code then both students will receive an F for the project. 
Note a person who gives his code to another student also fails the project (you are facilitating the dishonest actions of another).

            Hello Professor Oscar,this semester is almost finished, and this is
            also my last semester in CSUN. We never talked before, and here is
            what I want to introduce myself again. My name is Yu Si, I am 25
            years old. I am pursuing my first bachelor's degree here. I come
            from China in 2015, I spent one year studying English. I began to
            take CSUN course in 2016. I published two essays in 2017. I gained
            four scholarships in 2018-2020. I attended The Mathematical Contest
            in Modeling ICM and my grade was Successful Participants. I've
            already sent more than 100 resumes but I haven't found an ideal job.
            Above is what I have done in the past five years.
